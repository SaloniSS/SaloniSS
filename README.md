## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Saloni Shivdasani (she/her).

### About Me ðŸ˜„

I am a junior at The University of Texas at Dallas, and I am currently majoring in Software Engineering with a concentration in Information Assurance. I am interested and have experience in full stack development, cloud computing, and cybersecurity. I hope to find opportunities where I can gain exposure to algorithm and project design. My ultimate aim is to develop futuristic products for users because I am inspired by the impact of computing on society.

I have experience in full stack web development through my participation and awards in hackathons where I have learnt and used React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Flask, NLTK, and React Native along with GIT, GCP, and Firebase. Last semester, I was also responsible for backend development for a project at a local NGO where I created a REST API using Node.js, Express, MongoDB and SQL and hosted it on servers using GCP. 

From my coursework and local competitions, I have skills in algorithms and data structures in Java, database management using SQL and machine learning using Python and R. I have also been a quarter-finalist in a national cybersecurity completion hosted by the SANS institute.

I am also actively involved in campus organization where I am the cloud technical lead for Developer Student Club, Mentor and Education Officer for Association of Computing Machinery, event planner for Women Mentoring Women in Engineering and IT Committee member for IEEE.
